# monthly-challenges-django
## This is a simple and my first website with Django.
### Notes:
#### 1.0.0 => 22'nd of December 2022
#### 1) Due to the lack of templates this is a HTML only website that will be updated in the future of course
#### 2) For the moment the website is nothing more than a code along project from a Udemy Course by Maximillian
#### 3) Here I have used dynamic path and dynamic view patterns.
#### 4) Currently the only thing that you will see is a list of months that can be clicked and redirect you to a certain challenge that I give to my self each month. The challenges are not serious of course. I will keep updating this project as my Django skills get better with the time.
